# Sampling and Data Structures {#ChapData}

## Student Learning Objectives

In this chapter we deal with issues associated with the data that is
obtained from a sample. The variability associated with this data is
emphasized and critical thinking about validity of the data encouraged.
A method for the introduction of data from an external source into `R`
is proposed and the data types used by `R` for storage are described. By
the end of this chapter, the student should be able to:

-   Recognize potential difficulties with sampled data.
-   Read an external data file into `R`.
-   Create and interpret frequency tables.

## The Sampled Data

The aim in statistics is to learn the characteristics of a population on
the basis of a sample selected from the population. An essential part of
this analysis involves consideration of variation in the data.

### Variation in Data

Variation is given a central role in statistics. To some extent the
assessment of variation and the quantification of its contribution to
uncertainties in making inference is the statistician’s main concern.

Variation is present in any set of data. For example, 16-ounce cans of
beverage may contain more or less than 16 ounces of liquid. In one
study, eight 16 ounce cans were measured and produced the following
amount (in ounces) of beverage:

$$15.8,16.1,15.2,14.8,15.8,15.9,16.0,15.5$$
Measurements of the amount of beverage in a 16-ounce may vary because
the conditions of measurement varied or because the exact amount, 16
ounces of liquid, was not put into the cans. Manufacturers regularly run
tests to determine if the amount of beverage in a 16-ounce can falls
within the desired range.

Be aware that if an investigator collects data, the data may vary
somewhat from the data someone else is taking for the same purpose. This
is completely natural. However, if two investigators or more, are taking
data from the same source and get very different results, it is time for
them to reevaluate their data-collection methods and data recording
accuracy.

### Variation in Samples

Two or more samples from the same population, all having the same
characteristics as the population, may nonetheless be different from
each other. Suppose Doreen and Jung both decide to study the average
amount of time students sleep each night and use all students at their
college as the population. Doreen may decide to sample randomly a given
number of students from the entire body of collage students. Jung, on
the other hand, may decide to sample randomly a given number of classes
and survey all students in the selected classes. Doreen’s method is
called *random sampling* whereas Jung’s method is called *cluster
sampling*. Doreen’s sample will be different from Jung’s sample even
though both samples have the characteristics of the population. Even if
Doreen and Jung used the same sampling method, in all likelihood their
samples would be different. Neither would be wrong, however.

If Doreen and Jung took larger samples (i.e. the number of data values
is increased), their sample results (say, the average amount of time a
student sleeps) would be closer to the actual population average. But
still, their samples would be, most probably, different from each other.

The size of a sample (often called the number of observations) is
important. The examples you have seen in this book so far have been
small. Samples of only a few hundred observations, or even smaller, are
sufficient for many purposes. In polling, samples that are from 1200 to
1500 observations are considered large enough and good enough if the
survey is random and is well done. The theory of statistical inference,
that is the subject matter of the second part of this book, provides
justification for these claims.

### Frequency

The primary way of summarizing the variability of data is via the
frequency distribution. Consider an example. Twenty students were asked
how many hours they worked per day. Their responses, in hours, are
listed below:

$$5,\; 6,\; 3,\; 3,\; 2,\; 4,\; 7,\; 5,\; 2,\; 3,\; 5,\; 6,\; 5,\; 4,\; 4,\; 3,\; 5,\; 2,\; 5,\; 3$$
Let us create an `R` object by the name “`work.hours`" that contains
these data:

```{r}
work.hours <- c(5,6,3,3,2,4,7,5,2,3,5,6,5,4,4,3,5,2,5,3)
```

Next, let us create a table that summarizes the different values of
working hours and the frequency in which these values appear in the
data:

```{r}
table(work.hours)
```

Recall that the function “`table`" takes as input a sequence of data and
produces as output the frequencies of the different values.

We may have a clearer understanding of the meaning of the output of the
function “`table`" if we presented outcome as a frequency listing the
different data values in ascending order and their frequencies. For that
end we may apply the function “`data.frame`" to the output of the
“`table`" function and obtain:

```{r, out.width = '40%', fig.align = "center"}
data.frame(table(work.hours))
```

A frequency is the number of times a given datum occurs in a data set.
According to the table above, there are three students who work 2 hours,
five students who work 3 hours, etc. The total of the frequency column,
20, represents the total number of students included in the sample.

The function “`data.frame`” transforms its input into a data frame,
which is the standard way of storing statistical data. We will introduce
data frames in more detail in Section \@ref(readingdata) below.

A relative frequency is the fraction of times a value occurs. To find
the relative frequencies, divide each frequency by the total number of
students in the sample – 20 in this case. Relative frequencies can be
written as fractions, percents, or decimals.

As an illustration let us compute the relative frequencies in our data:

```{r}
freq <- table(work.hours)
freq
sum(freq)
freq/sum(freq)
```

We stored the frequencies in an object called “`freq`". The content of
the object are the frequencies 3, 5, 3, 6, 2 and 1. The function “`sum`"
sums the components of its input. The sum of the frequencies is the
sample size , the total number of students that responded to the survey,
which is 20. Hence, when we apply the function “`sum`" to the object
“`freq`" we get 20 as an output.

The outcome of dividing an object by a number is a division of each
element in the object by the given number. Therefore, when we divide
“`freq`" by “`sum(freq)`" (the number 20) we get a sequence of relative
frequencies. The first entry to this sequence is $3/20 = 0.15$, the
second entry is $5/20 = 0.25$, and the last entry is $1/20 = 0.05$. The
sum of the relative frequencies should always be equal to 1:

```{r}
sum(freq/sum(freq))
```

The cumulative relative frequency is the accumulation of previous
relative frequencies. To find the cumulative relative frequencies, add
all the previous relative frequencies to the relative frequency of the
current value. Alternatively, we may apply the function “`cumsum`" to
the sequence of relative frequencies:

```{r}
cumsum(freq/sum(freq))
```

Observe that the cumulative relative frequency of the smallest value 2
is the frequency of that value (0.15). The cumulative relative frequency
of the second value 3 is the sum of the relative frequency of the
smaller value (0.15) and the relative frequency of the current value
(0.25), which produces a total of $0.15 + 0.25 = 0.40$. Likewise, for
the third value 4 we get a cumulative relative frequency of
$0.15 + 0.25 + 0.15 = 0.55$. The last entry of the cumulative relative
frequency column is one, indicating that one hundred percent of the data
has been accumulated.

The computation of the cumulative relative frequency was carried out
with the aid of the function “`cumsum`". This function takes as an input
argument a numerical sequence and produces as output a numerical
sequence of the same length with the cumulative sums of the components
of the input sequence.

### Critical Evaluation

Inappropriate methods of sampling and data collection may produce
samples that do not represent the target population. A naïve application
of statistical analysis to such data may produce misleading conclusions.

Consequently, it is important to evaluate critically the statistical
analyses we encounter before accepting the conclusions that are obtained
as a result of these analyses. Common problems that occurs in data that
one should be aware of include:

Problems with Samples:

:   A sample should be representative of the population. A sample that
    is not representative of the population is biased. Biased samples
    may produce results that are inaccurate and not valid.

Data Quality:

:   Avoidable errors may be introduced to the data via inaccurate
    handling of forms, mistakes in the input of data, etc. Data should
    be cleaned from such errors as much as possible.

Self-Selected Samples:

:   Responses only by people who choose to respond, such as call-in
    surveys, that are often biased.

Sample Size Issues:

:   Samples that are too small may be unreliable. Larger samples, when
    possible, are better. In some situations, small samples are
    unavoidable and can still be used to draw conclusions. Examples:
    Crash testing cars, medical testing for rare conditions.

Undue Influence:

:   Collecting data or asking questions in a way that influences the
    response.

Causality:

:   A relationship between two variables does not mean that one causes
    the other to occur. They may both be related (correlated) because of
    their relationship to a third variable.

Self-Funded or Self-Interest Studies:

:   A study performed by a person or organization in order to support
    their claim. Is the study impartial? Read the study carefully to
    evaluate the work. Do not automatically assume that the study is
    good but do not automatically assume the study is bad either.
    Evaluate it on its merits and the work done.

Misleading Use of Data:

:   Improperly displayed graphs and incomplete data.

Confounding:

:   Confounding in this context means confusing. When the effects of
    multiple factors on a response cannot be separated. Confounding
    makes it difficult or impossible to draw valid conclusions about the
    effect of each factor.

## Reading Data into `R` {#readingdata}

In the examples so far the size of the data set was very small and we
were able to input the data directly into `R` with the use of the
function “`c`". In more practical settings the data sets to be analyzed
are much larger and it is very inefficient to enter them manually. In
this section we learn how to upload data from a file in the Comma
Separated Values (CSV) format.

The file “`ex1.csv`" contains data on the sex and height of 100
individuals. This file is given in the CSV format. The file can be found
on the internet at
<http://pluto.huji.ac.il/~msby/StatThink/Datasets/ex1.csv>. We will
discuss the process of reading data from a file into `R` and use this
file as an illustration.

### Saving the File and Setting the Working Directory

Before the file is read into `R` you may find it convenient to obtain a
copy of the file and store it in some directory on the computer and read
the file from that directory. We recommend that you create a special
directory in which you keep all the material associated with this
course. In the explanations provided below we assume that the directory
to which the file is stored in called “`IntroStat`". (See
Figure \@ref(fig:Data1)

```{r Data1, fig.cap='The File “`ex1.csv`"', echo=FALSE, message=FALSE,warning=FALSE, out.width = '60%', fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("_figures/Data-file.png")
```

Files in the CSV format are ordinary text files. They can be created
manually or as a result of converting data stored in a different format
into this particular format. A convenient way to produce, browse and
edit CSV files is by the use of a standard electronic spreadsheet
programs such as Excel or Calc. The Excel spreadsheet is part of the
Microsoft’s Office suite. The Calc spreadsheet is part of the free [LibreOffice
suite](http://www.libreoffice.org/).

Opening a CSV file by a spreadsheet program displays a spreadsheet with
the content of the file. Values in the cells of the spreadsheet may be
modified directly. (However, when saving, one should pay attention to
save the file in the CVS format.) Similarly, new CSV files may be
created by the entering of the data in an empty spreadsheet. The first
row should include the name of the variable, preferably as a single
character string with no empty spaces. The following rows may contain
the data values associated with this variable. When saving, the
spreadsheet should be saved in the CSV format by the use of the “"
dialog and choosing there the option of CSV in the “`Save by Type`"
selection.

After saving a file with the data in a directory, `R` should be notified
where the file is located in order to be able to read it. A simple way
of doing so is by setting the directory with the file as `R`’s *working
directory*. The working directory is the first place `R` is searching
for files. Files produced by `R` are saved in that directory. In
Windows, during an active `R` session, one may set the working directory
to be some target directory with the “`File/Change Dir...`" dialog. This
dialog is opened by selecting the option “`File`" on the left hand side
of the ruler on the top of the `R Console` window. Selecting the option
of “`Change Dir...`" in the ruler that opens will start the dialog. (See
Figure \@ref(fig:Data2).) Browsing via this dialog window to the
directory of choice, selecting it, and approving the selection by
clicking the “`OK`" bottom in the dialog window will set the directory
of choice as the working directory of `R`.

```{r Data2, fig.cap='Changing The Working Directory', echo=FALSE, message=FALSE,warning=FALSE, out.width = '60%', fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("_figures/Data-change-dir.png")
```

Rather than changing the working directory every time that `R` is opened
one may set a selected directory to be `R`’s working directory on
opening. Again, we demonstrate how to do this on the XP Windows
operating system.

The `R` icon was added to the Desktop when the `R` system was installed.
The `R Console` is opened by double-clicking on this icon. One may
change the properties of the icon so that it sets a directory of choice
as `R`’s working directory.

In order to do so click on the icon with the mouse’s [**right**]{}
bottom. A menu opens in which you should select the option
“`Properties`". As a result, a dialog window opens. (See
Figure \@ref(fig:Data1).) Look at the line that starts with the words
“`Start in`" and continues with a name of a directory that is the
current working directory. The name of this directory is enclosed in
double quotes and is given with it’s full path, i.e. its address on the
computer. This name and path should be changed to the name and path of
the directory that you want to fix as the new working directory.

```{r Data3, fig.cap='Setting the Working Directory (Before the Change)', echo=FALSE, message=FALSE,warning=FALSE, out.width = '60%', fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("_figures/Data-set-dir-before.png")
```

```{r Data4, fig.cap='Setting the Working Directory (After the Change)', echo=FALSE, message=FALSE,warning=FALSE, out.width = '60%', fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("_figures/Data-set-dir-after.png")
```

Consider again Figure \@ref(fig:Data1). Imagine that one wants to fix the
directory that contains the file “`ex1.csv`" as the permanent working
directory. Notice that the full address of the directory appears at the
“`Address`" bar on the top of the window. One may copy the address and
paste it instead of the name of the current working directory that is
specified in the “`Properties`" dialog of the `R` icon. One should make
sure that the address to the new directory is, again, placed between
double-quotes. (See in Figure \@ref(fig:Data4) the dialog window after
the changing the address of the working directory. Compare this to
Figure \@ref(fig:Data3) of the window before the change.) After approving
the change by clicking the “`OK`" bottom the new working directory is
set. Henceforth, each time that the `R Console` is opened by
double-clicking the icon it will have the designated directory as its
working directory.

In the rest of this book we assume that a designated directory is set as
`R`’s working directory and that all external files that need to be read
into `R`, such as “`ex1.csv`" for example, are saved in that working
directory. Once a working directory has been set then the history of
subsequent `R` sessions is stored in that directory. Hence, if you
choose to save the image of the session when you end the session then
objects created in the session will be uploaded the next time the
`R Console` is opened.

### Reading a CSV File into `R` {#Data_3}

Now that a copy of the file “`ex1.csv`" is placed in the working
directory we would like to read its content into `R`. Reading of files
in the CSV format can be carried out with the `R` function “`read.csv`".
To read the file of the example we run the following line of code in the
`R Console` window:

```{r}
ex.1 <- read.csv("_data/ex1.csv")
```

The function “`read.csv`" takes as an input argument the address of a
CSV file and produces as output a *data frame* object with the content
of the file. Notice that the address is placed between double-quotes. If
the file is located in the working directory then giving the name of the
file as an address is sufficient[^2_1].

Consider the content of that `R` object “`ex.1`" that was created by the
previous expression, by inspecting the first part using the function “`head()`":

```{r}
head(ex.1)
```

The object “`ex.1`", the output of the function “`read.csv`" is a *data
frame*. Data frames are the standard tabular format of storing
statistical data. The columns of the table are called *variables* and
correspond to measurements. In this example the three variables are:

id:

:   A 7 digits number that serves as a unique identifier of the subject.

sex:

:   The sex of each subject. The values are either “`MALE`" or
    “`FEMALE`".

height:

:   The height (in centimeter) of each subject. A numerical value.

When the values of the variable are numerical we say that it is a
*quantitative variable* or a *numeric variable*. On the other hand, if
the variable has qualitative or level values we say that it is a
*factor*. In the given example, `sex` is a factor and `height` is a
numeric variable.

The rows of the table are called *observations* and correspond to the
subjects. In this data set there are 100 subjects, with subject number
1, for example, being a female of height 182 cm and identifying number
5696379. Subject number 98, on the other hand, is a male of height 195
cm and identifying number 9383288.

### Data Types

The columns of `R` data frames represent variables, i.e. measurements
recorded for each of the subjects in the sample. `R` associates with
each variable a type that characterizes the content of the variable. The
two major types are

-   Factors, or Qualitative Data. The type is “`factor`".

-   Quantitative Data. The type is “`numeric`".

Factors are the result of categorizing or describing attributes of a
population. Hair color, blood type, ethnic group, the car a person
drives, and the street a person lives on are examples of qualitative
data. Qualitative data are generally described by words or letters. For
instance, hair color might be black, dark brown, light brown, blonde,
gray, or red. Blood type might be AB+, O-, or B+. Qualitative data are
not as widely used as quantitative data because many numerical
techniques do not apply to the qualitative data. For example, it does
not make sense to find an average hair color or blood type.

Quantitative data are always numbers and are usually the data of choice
because there are many methods available for analyzing such data.
Quantitative data are the result of counting or measuring attributes of
a population. Amount of money, pulse rate, weight, number of people
living in your town, and the number of students who take statistics are
examples of quantitative data.

Quantitative data may be either discrete or continuous. All data that
are the result of counting are called quantitative discrete data. These
data take on only certain numerical values. If you count the number of
phone calls you receive for each day of the week, you may get results
such as 0, 1, 2, 3, etc. On the other hand, data that are the result of
measuring on a continuous scale are quantitative continuous data,
assuming that we can measure accurately. Measuring angles in radians may
result in the numbers $\frac{\pi}{6}$, $\frac{\pi}{3}$, $\frac{\pi}{2}$,
$\pi$, $\frac{3\pi}{4}$, etc. If you and your friends carry backpacks
with books in them to school, the numbers of books in the backpacks are
discrete data and the weights of the backpacks are continuous data.

The data are the number of books students carry in their backpacks. You
sample five students. Two students carry 3 books, one student carries 4
books, one student carries 2 books, and one student carries 1 book. The
numbers of books (3, 4, 2, and 1) are the quantitative discrete data.

The data are the weights of the backpacks with the books in it. You
sample the same five students. The weights (in pounds) of their
backpacks are 6.2, 7, 6.8, 9.1, 4.3. Notice that backpacks carrying
three books can have different weights. Weights are quantitative
continuous data because weights are measured.

The data are the colors of backpacks. Again, you sample the same five
students. One student has a red backpack, two students have black
backpacks, one student has a green backpack, and one student has a gray
backpack. The colors red, black, black, green, and gray are qualitative
data.

The distinction between continuous and discrete numeric data is not
reflected usually in the statistical method that are used in order to
analyze the data. Indeed, `R` does not distinguish between these two
types of numeric data and store them both as “`numeric`". Consequently,
we will also not worry about the specific categorization of numeric data
and treat them as one. On the other hand, emphasis will be given to the
difference between numeric and factors data.

One may collect data as numbers and report it categorically. For
example, the quiz scores for each student are recorded throughout the
term. At the end of the term, the quiz scores are reported as A, B, C,
D, or F. On the other hand, one may code categories of qualitative data
with numerical values and report the values. The resulting data should
nonetheless be treated as a factor.

As default, `R` saves variables that contain non-numeric values as
factors. Otherwise, the variables are saved as numeric. The variable
type is important because different statistical methods are applied to
different data types. Hence, one should make sure that the variables
that are analyzed have the appropriate type. Especially that factors
using numbers to denote the levels are labeled as factors. Otherwise `R`
will treat them as quantitative data.

### Discuss in the forum {#discuss-in-the-forum .unnumbered}

Factors are qualitative data that are associated with categorization or
the description of an attribute. On the other hand, numeric data are
generated by numerical measurements. A common practice is to code the
levels of factors using numerical values. What do you think of this
practice?

In the formulation of your answer to the question you may think of an
example of factor variable from your own field of interest. You may
describe a benefit or a disadvantage that results from the use of a
numerical values to code the level of this factor.

[^2_1]: If the file is located in a different directory then the complete
    address, including the path to the file, should be provided. The
    file need not reside on the computer. One may provide, for example,
    a URL (an internet address) as the address. Thus, instead of saving
    the file of the example on the computer one may read its content
    into an `R` object by using the line of code
    “`ex.1 <- read.csv(http://pluto.huji.ac.il/~msby/StatThink/Datasets/ex1.csv)`"
    instead of the code that we provide and the working method that we
    recommend to follow.
